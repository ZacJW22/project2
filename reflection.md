# Reflection Markdown
This site is my submission for the 3rd project of Front End Web Design - Outside the Grid

For this project, we were allowed to base the topic on anything we liked and I decided to do my site on my most recent karting race. I chose this as karting is pretty much my entire life outside of work and university. I spend hours and hours every week either tinkering with it or ripping laps at the local track trying to find that extra little bit of lap time to get me closer to the front. I won't go into detail about how I went in this markdown, as I'll let you read that for yourself. That is what the site is based on after all.
