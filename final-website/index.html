<p>This year I raced Tag Light in what was a super competitive field, with nearly everyone only split by a couple of tenths! Unfortunately it wasn't quite the result I was hoping for. After looking strong in the early practice sessions, I got lost trying to nail the setup and never really recovered. Qualifying in P10 in a field of 18 wasn't a terrible result, but wasn't what I was aiming for either and left me with work to do in the heats. After a disappointing first two heats where I finished 13th and 16th, I tried to make my way forward in the pre final. I was running as high as 9th after starting 16th, however got caught up in a mad fight with other drivers in the last few laps and ended up finishing 12th. For the final I started in 14th and after a really strong first few laps where I was deep in the battle for 5th or 6th, my pace just wasn't quite as good as it had been in the pre final and I slumped down to 13th by the chequered flag. As always thanks to everyone that supported me over the weekend and in particular Brett from Kartshed Racing for parts and helping me prepare for this weekend, as well as KNSW and Circuit Mark Webber for putting on an awesome weekend. Onto the next one ðŸ‘Š</p>
